        ========================
         
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Clone this repository and adopt the todocli structure for your own project.
        This is just a starting point, but I hope a good one. From there on, you should
        read and follow http://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/,
        the definite resource on Python packaging.
        
        
        
        
        On Unix-like systems, the installation places a ``todocli`` script into a
        centralized ``bin`` directory, which should be in your ``PATH``. On Windows,
        ``todocli.exe`` is placed into a centralized ``Scripts`` directory which
        should also be in your ``PATH``.
